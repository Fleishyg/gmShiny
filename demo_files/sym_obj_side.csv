Notes,
,These notes are designed to assist the formatting of your own OBJECT symmetry file for upload into gmShiny
,This means that both sides of the symmetrical object are represented in each shape object
,This  file assigns the landmark pairs to the corresponding side
,DELETE ALL NOTES before attempting to upload them into the app
,
,Each row represents the left and right side of the homologous trait
,"Each column must consistently represent the same side of the symmetric object. E.g., all landmarks for the left side should be in the same column"
,
,"The example Plethodon dataset does not actually have a symmetric component to it in real life, but this example can help demonstrate how to apply symmetry if, as is the case here, LMs 4567&8 were all on the left side of the salamander head while 1 2 11 10 & 9 were the matching lms on the right side of the salamander head"
