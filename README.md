Shiny App Interface for geomorph

See Baken et al 2021 for information on the shiny app introduction. This app is recommended for use of small to moderate datasets. For more complex analyses or analysis of large datasets, please use geomorph directly in R or R Studio.

App currently accessible at https://ebaken.shinyapps.io/Geomorph_v1, but this link is likely to change before Baken et al 2021 full publication.
